# ProjectEuler

Creating a simple solution guide (in Python 3) for all problems listed on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about).

<br/>

Many of the solutions are written in Python, but some have been written out on the corresponding folder's README inside the respective folder since it is easier to solve logically and mathematically.
