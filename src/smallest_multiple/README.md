# Solution

We are already given that 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. Now, we just have to consider for all number 11 ~ 20, inclusive.
<br/>
From a logical point of view, we just have to consider whether we account for all the prime factors of all natural numbers between 1 ~ 20. Considering all positive prime numbers less than 20, we have *2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19.*
<br/>
Except for 2 and 3, every other prime number listed above only have to be multipled once since the square of those prime numbers are greater than 20. For 2 and 3, we would need 4 and 2, respectively, since 2<sup>4</sup> = 16 and 3<sup>2</sup> = 9.
<br/>
Thus, the product of all those numbers are 16 * 9 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 = 232792560.
